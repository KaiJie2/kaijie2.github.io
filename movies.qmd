### Movie Ratings
I love movies, hence I created this page to share my thoughts on some of my favorite movies. \
#### 1. Minecraft Movie
Kids movie, not worth watching as an adult. But totally brings back some childhood memories. \
#### 2. Harry Potter
I really don't understand the hype. I mean, it's a good movie, but not as good as the hype. \
#### 3. Captain America: Brave New World
I love the Captain America series. The action, the story, the characters, everything. But this was quite a disappointment \
