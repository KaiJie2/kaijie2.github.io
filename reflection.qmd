### Reflection on the use of GenAI
#### What is the GenAI tool you have used? Why did you choose it?
I have used ChatGPT as my GenAI tool. I chose it because it is a well-known and widely used tool that can generate human-like text based on the input provided. It is also easy to use and has a user-friendly interface. \
Github Copilot was used too as it integrates into RStudio which was the main IDE used to complete this assessment. \
#### How did the GenAI tool help you in completing the assessment (with examples)?
I used ChatGPT to generate ideas for my project and to help me with the writing process. For example, I asked it to help me come up with a ... for my project and it provided several suggestions. \
#### What do you think are beneficial about the tool?
It's super quick \
#### What do you think are challenging about the tool?
The prompts have to be just right, else it will not give the right answer. \
#### How do you think will GenAI tools assist you for your future study or work?
I think GenAI tools will be very useful in the future for generating ideas, writing code, and definitely debugging. \
#### Any other thoughts you would like to share.
Unfortunately, I used GenAI to write this reflection. \
