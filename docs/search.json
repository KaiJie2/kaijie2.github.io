Proficient in analysing data into granular bits for solving real world issues with insights.\n\n\n\nI am a passionate learner who is always eager to explore new technologies and methodologies. I have a strong foundation in programming languages and data analysis, and I am excited to apply my skills in real-world projects.\n\n\nSkills\nCoding: Python, Java, C, R, Bash, JavaScript, HTML, CSS\n\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\n[1] \"Hello World\"\n\n\nDon’t worry, I can code much more than this\n\n\nWork Experience\nLinkedIn\n\n\nMansa Computers: Research and Development Lead\n\nGroup IB: Junior Integration/Implementation Engineer\n\n\n\n\nInterests\n\nI like to code in my free time!\n\nAs with all other guys, I like gaming.\n\nI am also a big fan of Korean Dramas"

It is easy to use, has a user-friendly interface and additionally, I have a Plus membership!\nGitHub Copilot was used too as it integrates into RStudio which was the main IDE used to complete this assessment.\n\n\n\nI used ChatGPT to debug issues for my project and to help me with the writing process. For example, I forgot how to embed a link and open it in a new tab without replacing the current open tab, and it provided several suggestions.\n\n\n\nIt’s super quick, I don’t understand how AI has lesser neurons than a brain but it’s somewhat faster. Maybe it is because AI has memory retention as compared to the human brain.\n\n\n\nThe prompts have to be just right, else it will not give the right answer and just gives you a hallucinated answer or something else entirely.\n\n\n\nI think GenAI tools will be very useful in the future for generating ideas, writing code, and definitely debugging. I would like to think I am not a very creative person, and being able to generate ideas on the go is quite a valuable skill.\n\n\n\nThe time to do this assessment is not enough."

But totally brings back some childhood memories.\n\n\n\n2. Harry Potter\nI really don’t understand the hype. I mean, it’s a good movie, but not as good as the hype.\n\n\n\n3. Captain America: Brave New World\n\nI love the Captain America series. The action, the story, the characters, everything. But this was quite a disappointment."
