    "text": "Reflection on the use of GenAI\n\nWhat is the GenAI tool you have used? Why did you choose it?\nI have used ChatGPT as my GenAI tool. I chose it because it is a well-known and widely used tool that can generate human-like text based on the input provided. It is also easy to use and has a user-friendly interface.\nGithub Copilot was used too as it integrates into RStudio which was the main IDE used to complete this assessment.\n\n\n\nHow did the GenAI tool help you in completing the assessment (with examples)?\nI used ChatGPT to generate ideas for my project and to help me with the writing process. For example, I forgot how to embed a link and open it in a new tab without replace the current open tab, and it provided several suggestions.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think are beneficial about the tool?\nIt’s super quick\n\n\n\nWhat do you think are challenging about the tool?\nThe prompts have to be just right, else it will not give the right answer.\n\n\n\nHow do you think will GenAI tools assist you for your future study or work?\nI think GenAI tools will be very useful in the future for generating ideas, writing code, and definitely debugging.\n\n\n\nAny other thoughts you would like to share.\nUnfortunately, I used GenAI to write this reflection."

This is my friend by the way.\n \n\n\nMovie Ratings\nI love movies, hence I created this page to share my thoughts on some of my favorite movies.\n\n\n1. Minecraft Movie\nKids movie, not worth watching as an adult. But totally brings back some childhood memories.\n\n\n\n2. Harry Potter\nI really don’t understand the hype. I mean, it’s a good movie, but not as good as the hype.\n\n\n\n3. Captain America: Brave New World\nI love the Captain America series. The action, the story, the characters, everything. But this was quite a disappointment"
